# ic-705-tools
Set of tools writen in different programming language based on what i really want to do. Sometimes it's python because i like to do things in console, sometimes it will be PHP for some dynamic websites.
Most of them will be proof-of-concept to show possibility with open source and this radio. Any  software that is not poc will be in seperate repository on my github.
